Recently, I am thinking about whether the cell phone has its own ip address and whether the ip address would be changed when moving to another location. The followings are some questions and answers I got when I am trying to track down this issue.

## **How does the server know the client's IP address?**

## **How does the proxy know the client's IP address when sending the response back?**

## **What's the difference between signature and fingerprint?**
