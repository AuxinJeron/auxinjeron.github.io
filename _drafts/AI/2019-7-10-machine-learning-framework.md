# Keras 
Keras is a deep-learning library that sits atop TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK, providing intuitive API inspired by Torch.

# TensorFlow
Google created TensorFlow to replace Theano
TF is about more than deep learning, actually has tools to support reinforcement learning and other algos

# scikit-learn
simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis
built on NumPy, SciPy, mamtplotlib

# Theano
Theano is effectively dead now
Theano is a library that handles multidimensional arrays, like Numpp.

# Pytorch & Torch
## Pytorch
the python version of Torch
open-sourced by facebook
## Torch
computational framework with an API written in Lua

# Caffe
Only for machine-vision library, not for other deep-learning applications such as text, sound or time series data

# Caffe2
Caffe2 is the long-awaited successor to the original Caffe. It is the second deep-learning framework to be backed by Facebook after Torch/PyTorch. Caffe2 is more scalale and light-weight.

# CNTK
CNTK is Microsoft's open-source deep-learning framework.

# DSSTNE
Amazon's Deep Scalable Sparse Tensor Network Engine

# Mxnet
MxNet is a machine-learning framework with APIs in lanuages such as R, Python and Julia which has been adopted by AWS

# Paddle
Paddle is a deep-learning framework created by Baidu
